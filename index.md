# *Friday* Notes
## Week 2
It is *Friday*
I think I need a cup of coffee, 
Please.
You may wonder at how I am doing today. Check the link.

**Coffee served today:**
* Americano
* Expresso
* Latte

**My logic**
1. I always have Latte on weekends. But not on a Friday.
2. Black coffee is good for a sleep-deprived person.
